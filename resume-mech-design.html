			<h2 id="headline">ME Sophomore at NIT Durgapur | Machine Learning Intern at Verzeo</h2>

			<p>I am a student of Mechanical Engineering and aspire to be a Mechanical Design Engineer. Currently a sophomore at the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, I am actively looking for internships in my area of study.</p>
			<p>I have excellent attention to detail and am good at three-dimensional visualization, given proper description. Armed with a fertile imagination, I pick up instructions and new skills pretty quickly once demonstrated.</p>
			<p>I am proficient in mechanical design software like AutoCAD, and comfortable with programming in Java, C, and MATLAB.</p>
			<p>I indulge in chess matches with my friends from time to time, and in my leisure, read books and watch movies.</p>

			<h3>Manual Robotics - Remote Operated Robot</h3>
			<img src="images/manual-robot.jpg" alt="Manual Robot - Remote Operated"/>
			<p>After learning the basics of manual robots like various motors, gears and switches, we built the robot in two days working as a team of three, in November 2019 at the Manual Robotics Workshop conducted by Robocell, CCA, with the help of senior members of CCA.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Took the necessary measurements for clamps and holders and fixed them in place for the motors.</li>
				<li>Installed wire connections from control hub of the remote to the motors.</li>
				<li>Tuned the positions of worm & spur gears to reduce noise while working.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Collaborators:</h4>

				<li>Jugantar Mukherjee</li>
				<li>Koustav Sanyal</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is a basic robot with grabbing arms, rough around the edges since we beginners then.</p>
